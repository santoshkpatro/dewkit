# DewKit

DewKit is an open-source, self-hosted customer support and ticketing platform.

It is designed as a modern alternative to proprietary tools like Intercom, Zendesk, and Crisp, while remaining simple to deploy and operate.

DewKit is built using:

- Go (backend)
- Vue.js (frontend)
- PostgreSQL (database)
- Redis (cache)

## Goals

- Simple deployment
- Minimal configuration
- Open-source by default
- Easy to self-host

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/santoshkpatro/dewkit
cd dewkit
```

Follow the installation guide to get started.
