# Deployment

DewKit is designed to be deployed as a single binary.

## General Deployment Steps

1. Build the project
2. Set required environment variables
3. Run `./dewkit install` (first time only)
4. Start server with `./dewkit runserver`

This model works across VMs, containers, and PaaS platforms.
